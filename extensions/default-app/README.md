# Default App

Change the default apps to open files of a particular type.

## Commands

### Set For Known File Types

List known file types and set default apps to open them. When you open this command, it loads all file types known to your system, which may take a moment. Once loaded, file types are cached so opening the command becomes _blazingly fast_!

You can search for file types by description (e.g., "JPEG Image"), extension (e.g., ".jpeg"), default opening app (e.g., "Preview"), or MIME type (e.g., "image/jpeg"). Pressing `⌘` + `⇧` + `D` toggles between a concise list and detailed view of the selected file type. You can also copy the name, uniform type identifier, extension, and MIME type of each file.

### Set Default App for File Type

Choose a file and set the default app to open all files of that type. After selecting a file, you can also copy its uniform type identifier, extension, and MIME type.
